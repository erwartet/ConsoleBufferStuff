# ConsoleBufferStuff

<p>
This repository includes everything I do with the windows command prompt, by using the console handle to draw all glyphs with an array.

<p>
Every project uses the pAulConsoleEngine.h header in the <a href="https://github.com/erwartet/ConsoleBufferStuff/blob/master/ConsoleEngine/pAulConsoleEngine.h">ConsoleEngine</a> project to make it easier to access this handle. I build this header by myself, but it's heavily inspired by <a href="https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/videos">olcConsoleGameEngine.h</a> header.

Nothing here is perfect, because this is to learn more about C++, std library, algorithms and so on. But feel free to look into it and copy anything you want. I'm always open for any improvments.
