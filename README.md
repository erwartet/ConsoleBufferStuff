# ConsoleBufferStuff

This repository includes everything I do with the windows command prompt, by using the console handle to draw all glyphs with an array.
Every project uses the pAulConsoleEngine.h header to make it easy. I build this header by myself, but it's heavily inspired by <a href="https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/videos">olcConsoleGameEngine.h</a> header.
