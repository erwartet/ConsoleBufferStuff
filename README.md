# ConsoleBufferStuff

<p>
This repository includes everything I do with the windows command prompt, by using the console handle to draw all glyphs with an array.

Every project uses the pAulConsoleEngine.h header in the <a href="https://github.com/erwartet/ConsoleBufferStuff/blob/master/ConsoleEngine/pAulConsoleEngine.h">ConsoleEngine</a> project to make it easier to access this handle. I build this header by myself, but it's heavily inspired by <a href="https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/videos">olcConsoleGameEngine.h</a> header.
